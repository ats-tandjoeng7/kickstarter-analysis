    <h3>Data Analytics Reflection Activity <small>(by S. Tandjoeng)</small></h3>
    <hr>
    <p><em>I</em> am thrilled to be in this class because I wanted to
      <ol>
        <li>master the ever-changing data visualization tools and their applications, </li>
        <li>keep up with the trends in terms of effective tools for data analytics and visualization, </li>
        <li>learn more about efficient collaboration tools, </li>
        <li>earn knowledge of how certain data analytics and visualization can be further performed by integrating AI and ML, and how to assess best tools.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p><em>In-depth</em> knowhow and techniques, including effectively assessing tools and debugging skills, will make us more efficient and effective. My expectation is this class will equip us with such in-depth knowhow and skills throughout and beyond this course that every cohort could apply to their real jobs. I also hope that we will gain solid data analyst and visualization skills that we can apply immediately without hesitation upon completion. Moreover, I look forward to learning about effective collaboration, time management, useful tips, other useful tools (e.g. Tableau, DataSpell), etc. Although I am new to online classes and feel extremely overwhelmed, I am sure that my growth mindset and your support will help me acquire new knowledge and best-known techniques from the academic support team, cohorts, and younger data scientists.</p>

    <p><em>My</em> objective is to apply the skills that I will learn from this class to empower my current job scopes, enhance my data analyst skill portfolio, and be a catalyst for growth in the workplace. Acquiring solid foundation of data analyst skills will help us assess efficient tools, adopt best-known method of shared repos, promote shared development, and enhance collaboration with coworkers while promoting healthy work-life balance. These skills will hopefully help cohorts better understand what, why, and how we strategically choose tools and their companions when addressing complex data visualization, statistical modeling, and ML in an efficient manner.</p>
